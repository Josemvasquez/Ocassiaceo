1. Create Vercel account (free)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Deploy with default settings
4. Add environment variables

### 3. Connect Your Domain
1. In Vercel dashboard, add custom domain: `www.ocassia.com`
2. Update your GoDaddy DNS to point to Vercel
3. SSL automatically configured

### 4. Database Setup
1. Set up Neon PostgreSQL (as planned)

## Domain DNS Changes Needed

**In GoDaddy DNS settings:**
- Change A record to point to Vercel's IP
- Or add CNAME for www to point to Vercel

**Vercel provides exact instructions** when you add the custom domain.

## Timeline
- **Setup**: 1-2 hours
- **DNS propagation**: 24-48 hours

Your Ocassia app will run exactly the same, just on better hosting that's designed for modern web applications.
