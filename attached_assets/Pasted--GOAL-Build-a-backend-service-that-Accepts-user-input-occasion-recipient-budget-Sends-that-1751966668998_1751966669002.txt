🧠 GOAL:
Build a backend service that:

Accepts user input (occasion, recipient, budget)

Sends that to OpenAI’s API

Returns smart gift suggestions

(Optional) Stores & tracks usage in Firestore

Frontend	FlutterFlow or Flutter
API Logic	Firebase Cloud Functions or BuildShip
AI Engine	OpenAI GPT-4 API
Storage	Firebase Firestore (optional)
Analytics	Firebase / Google Analytics

🔁 Step-by-Step Backend Flow
✅ 1. User Input (from app)
Fields:

Recipient (e.g. "my wife")

Occasion (e.g. "birthday")

Age (optional)

Interests (optional)

Budget (e.g. $50)

This gets passed to the backend via a POST request.

✅ 2. Firebase Function / BuildShip Action
In Firebase or BuildShip, create a callable function:

🔐 Example (Node.js Firebase Function):
js
Copy
Edit
const functions = require("firebase-functions");
const axios = require("axios");

exports.generateGiftIdeas = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const prompt = `Suggest 5 thoughtful birthday gifts under $${data.budget} for ${data.recipient}.`;
  const openaiResponse = await axios.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", {
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a gift expert and product recommender." },
      { role: "user", content: prompt }
    ]
  }, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${functions.config().openai.key}`
    }
  });

  const ideas = openaiResponse.data.choices[0].message.content;
  return { ideas };
});
🔐 Use functions.config().openai.key to securely store your OpenAI API key via Firebase CLI.

✅ 3. OpenAI Prompt Engineering
Make the prompt smart & personalized:

text
Copy
Edit
You are an expert gift assistant. Recommend 5 unique gift ideas for:
- Recipient: my boyfriend
- Occasion: birthday
- Age: 27
- Interests: fitness, tech, travel
- Budget: $75

Format your reply as a list with short explanations.
You can even train it to:

Add affiliate-style product names

Match with common brands (Amazon, Etsy, etc.)

Include estimated price

✅ 4. Response Handling
Return the AI-generated gift list to the frontend. You can:

Display it as cards in a ListView

Add a “Save Gift” button

Let users tap for affiliate links

✅ 5. (Optional) Store Suggestions in Firestore
You may want to log:

Suggestions returned

User that requested them

Timestamp

Which one was clicked/saved

This gives you analytics + insights for later monetization.

✅ Final Output (Frontend Display Example):
🎁 “Smart Dumbbell with App Sync – $65”

🎧 “Wireless Travel Earbuds – under $75”

🧳 “Personalized Luggage Tags for frequent flyers”
