# Ocassia Development Workflow & Future Updates

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Development Strategy

### Development Environment Options

#### Option 1: Replit (Recommended for Quick Changes)
- **Current setup**: Keep this Replit project as your development environment
- **Benefits**: Instant setup, no local configuration needed, accessible anywhere
- **Use for**: Quick fixes, feature additions, testing new ideas
- **Workflow**: Make changes here â†’ test â†’ deploy to production

#### Option 2: Local Development Setup
- **Setup**: Clone repository to your local machine
- **Benefits**: Faster development, offline work, better debugging tools
- **Requirements**: Node.js, Git, code editor (VS Code recommended)
- **Use for**: Major feature development, complex debugging

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)
- **Primary development**: Replit for quick changes and prototyping
- **Major features**: Local development for complex work
- **Team collaboration**: GitHub repository for version control

## ðŸš€ Deployment Pipeline

### Development â†’ Production Flow

```
1. Development (Replit/Local)
   â†“
2. Testing & Quality Assurance
   â†“
3. Build Production Version
   â†“
4. Deploy to Production Server
   â†“
5. Update Mobile Apps (if needed)
```

### Automated Deployment Options

#### Option A: Manual Deployment (Simple)
1. Make changes in development environment
2. Test changes thoroughly
3. Build production version: `npm run build`
4. Upload to production server
5. Restart application

#### Option B: GitHub Actions (Automated)
1. Push changes to GitHub repository
2. Automated testing runs
3. Automatic deployment to production server
4. Notifications on deployment status

#### Option C: CI/CD Pipeline (Professional)
1. Development changes trigger automated pipeline
2. Tests, security scans, and quality checks
3. Staging environment deployment for final testing
4. Production deployment with rollback capability

## ðŸ“± Mobile App Update Process

### React Native App Updates

#### Over-the-Air Updates (Expo)
- **Instant updates**: JavaScript changes deploy immediately
- **No app store approval**: For most feature updates
- **User experience**: Updates download automatically

#### App Store Updates (Native Changes)
- **When needed**: New native features, major version changes
- **Process**: Build â†’ Submit â†’ App store review â†’ Release
- **Timeline**: 1-7 days for approval

## ðŸ›  Development Tools & Setup

### Recommended Development Stack

#### Version Control
```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init
git remote add origin your-github-repo-url

# Development workflow
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create pull request â†’ merge to main
```

#### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone your-repo-url
cd ocassia

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

#### Recommended VS Code Extensions
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Auto Rename Tag
- GitLens
- Thunder Client (API testing)

## ðŸ”§ Database Management

### Schema Changes & Migrations

#### Development Process
1. **Modify schema**: Update `shared/schema.ts`
2. **Generate migration**: `npm run db:generate`
3. **Test locally**: `npm run db:push`
4. **Deploy to production**: Run migration on production database

#### Database Backup Strategy
```bash
# Automated daily backups
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Point-in-time recovery (Neon provides this)
# Restore from backup if needed
```

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Collaboration Workflow

### If Working with Developers

#### Code Review Process
1. **Feature branches**: Each feature in separate branch
2. **Pull requests**: Mandatory code review before merging
3. **Testing requirements**: All features must include tests
4. **Documentation**: Update docs with new features

#### Communication Tools
- **GitHub Issues**: Track bugs and feature requests
- **Project board**: Kanban-style task management
- **Discord/Slack**: Team communication
- **Weekly standups**: Progress updates and planning

### Project Management
- **Roadmap planning**: Quarterly feature planning
- **Sprint cycles**: 2-week development cycles
- **User feedback**: Regular user testing and feedback collection
- **Analytics**: Track user engagement and feature usage

---

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Maintenance

### Production Monitoring

#### Application Health
- **Uptime monitoring**: Track server availability
- **Error tracking**: Automatic error reporting (Sentry)
- **Performance monitoring**: Response times and database queries
- **User analytics**: Feature usage and user behavior

#### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Security updates**: Monthly dependency updates
- **Database maintenance**: Weekly performance optimization
- **Backup verification**: Test restore procedures monthly
- **SSL certificate renewal**: Automated with Let's Encrypt

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Development Priorities
